    "text": "Data Science involves a combination of math/statistics and programming/coding skills, which, for our purposes, we will combine with social science knowledge.\n\nDrew Conway has a nice venn diagram of how these different skill sets intersect.\nNote: This course will not assume prior familiarity with data science in general or coding, specifically. For those brand new to data science, the idea of learning to code may seem intimidating, but anyone can succeed with a bit of patience and an open mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe science of politics, of course! Politics focuses on studying governance and the distribution of power in society, broadly conceived.\n\nHow else might you define politics and political science? What do we study in political science?\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Data Science Can Help Social Scientists\nExample: Mapping poverty using mobile phone and satellite data\nResearchers used modern data sources, including mobile phone data, as a way to predict and describe poverty in different geographic regions. These tools helped social scientists come up with methods that are much more cost-effective and efficient, but still as accurate as traditional methods for this type of measurement.\n\nHow might measures of global poverty be useful to political scientists?\n\n\nSteele et al. 2017: “Poverty is one of the most important determinants of adverse health outcomes globally, a major cause of societal instability and one of the largest causes of lost human potential. Traditional approaches to measuring and targeting poverty rely heavily on census data, which in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are unavailable or out-of-date. Alternat emeasures are needed to complement and update estimates between censuses. This study demonstrates how public and private data sources that are commonly available for LMICs can be used to provide novel insight into the spatial distribution of poverty.We evaluate the relative value of modelling three traditional poverty measures using aggregate data from mobile operators and widely available geospatial data.”\n\n\n1.1.2 Course Goals\nSocial Science Goals\nWe have several goals in social science. Here are four that data science can help us pursue:\n\nDescribe and measure\n\nHas the U.S. population increased?\n\nExplain, evaluate, and recommend (study of causation)\n\nDoes expanding Medicaid improve health outcomes?\n\nPredict\n\nWho will win the next election?\n\nDiscover\n\nHow do policies diffuse across states?\n\n\nWhat are other examples of these goals?\nNote: In this course, we are exploiting the benefits of quantitative data to help achieve goals of social science. However, quantitative data have their shortcomings, too. We will also discuss the limitations of various applications of social science data, and we encourage you to always think critically about how we are using data.\nThis course will provide you with a taste of each of these social science goals, and how the use of data can help achieve these goals. By the end of the course, you should be able to\n\nProvide examples of how quantitative data may be used to help answer social science research questions.\nCompare and contrast the goals of description, causation, prediction, and discovery in social science research.\nUse the programming language R to import and explore social science data and conduct basic statistical analyses.\nInterpret and describe visual displays of social science data, such as graphs and maps.\nDevelop your own analyses and visualizations to understand social science phenomena.\n\nIf you are someone that loves data, we hope you will find this course engaging. If you are someone who loathes or finds the idea of working with data and statistics alarming, we hope you keep an open mind. We will meet you where you are. This course will not assume knowledge of statistical software, and there will be plenty of opportunities to ask questions and seek help from classmates and the instructor throughout the semester.\nThe first section of course will walk people through how to use the statistical program– R– that we will employ this semester.\nWill this course help me in the future?\nEven if you do not plan on becoming a social scientist or a data scientist, an introduction to these skills may prove helpful throughout your academic and professional careers.\n\nTo become an informed consumer of news articles and research involving quantitative analyses.\nTo practice analytical thinking to make informed arguments and decisions.\nTo expand your toolkit for getting a job that may involve consuming or performing some data analysis, even if that is not the traditional role.\n\nExample: Journalism- How 5 Data Dynamos Do Their Jobs",

    "section": "1.2 Setup in R",
    "text": "1.2 Setup in R\nGoal\nBy the end of the first week of the course, you will want to have R and RStudio installed on your computer (both free), feel comfortable using R as a calculator, and making documents using the R Markdown file type within RStudio.\nR is an application that processes the R programming language. RStudio is also an application, which serves as a user interface that makes working in R easier. We will primarily open and use RStudio to work with R.\nIn other classes, you may come across Stata, SPSS, Excel, or SAS, which are programs that also conduct data analysis. R has the advantage of being free and open-source. Even after you leave the university setting, you will be able to use R/RStudio for free. As an open-source program, it is very flexible, and a community of active R/RStudio users is constantly adding to and improving the program. You might also encounter the Python language at some point. R and Python have similarities, and learning R can also make learning Python easier down the road.\nR and RStudio Installation\nIMPORTANT: Note the 2 Steps. These are 2 separate applications you must install. Installing one without the other will not work for our purposes.\nThis content follows and reinforces section QSS 1.3 in our book. Additional resources are also linked below.\n\nThis video from Professor Christopher Bail explains why many social scientists use R and describes the R and RStudio installation process. This involves\n\nGoing to cran, select the link that matches your operating system, and then follow the installation instructions, and\nVisiting RStudio and follow the download and installation instructions. R is the statistical software and programming language used for analysis. RStudio provides a convenient user interface for running R code.",

    "section": "1.3 Open R Script in RStudio",
    "text": "1.3 Open R Script in RStudio\nThis next section provides a few notes on using R and RStudio now that you have installed it. In this section, we cover the following materials:\n\nUsing R as a calculator and assigning objects using &lt;-\nSetting your working directory and the setwd() function.\nCreating and saving an R script (.R file)\nCreating, saving, and compiling an R Markdown document (.Rmd) into an html document (.html)\n\nThis section highlights important concepts from QSS chapter 1.\nRStudio is an open-source and free program that greatly facilitates the use of R, especially for users new to programming. Once you have downloaded and installed R and RStudio, to work in R, all you need to do now is open RStudio (it will open R). It should look like this, though your version numbers will be different:\n\nNote: The first time you open RStudio, you likely only have the three windows above. We will want to create a fourth window by opening an R script to create the fourth window.\n\nTo do this, in RStudio, click on File -&gt; New -&gt; R script in your computer’s toolbar. This will open a blank document for text editing in the upper left of the RStudio window. We will return to this window in a moment.\n\nYou can alternatively click on the green + sign indicator in the top-left corner of the RStudio window, which should give you the option to create a new R script document.\n\n\nNow you should have something that looks like this, similar to Figure 1.1. in QSS:\n\n\nThe upper-left window has our .R script document that will contain code.\nThe lower-left window is the console. This will show the output of the code we run. We will also be able to type directly in the console.\nThe upper-right window shows the environment (and other tabs, such as the history of commands). When we load and store data in RStudio, we will see a summary of that in the environment.\nThe lower-right window will enable us to view plots and search help files, among other things.\n\n\n1.3.1 Using R as a Calculator\nThe bottom left window in your RStudio is the Console. You can type in this window to use R as a calculator or to try out commands. It will show the raw output of any commands you type. For example, we can try to use R as a calculator. Type the following in the Console (the bottom left window) and hit “enter” or “return” on your keyboard:\n\n5 + 3\n\n[1] 8\n\n5 - 3\n\n[1] 2\n\n5^2\n\n[1] 25\n\n5 * 3\n\n[1] 15\n\n5/3\n\n[1] 1.666667\n\n(5 + 3) * 2\n\n[1] 16\n\n\nAgain, in the other RStudio windows, the upper right will show a history of commands that you have sent from the text editor to the R console, along with other items. The lower right will show graphs, help documents and other features. These will be useful later in the course.\n\n\n1.3.2 Working in an R Script\nEarlier, I asked you to open an R script in the upper left window by doing File, then New File, then R Script. Let’s go back to working in that window.\nSet your working directory setwd()\nMany times you work in RStudio, the first thing you will do is set your working directory. This is a designated folder in your computer where you will save your R scripts and datasets.\nThere are many ways to do this.\n\nAn easy way is to go to Session -&gt; Set Working Directory -&gt; Choose Directory. I suggest choosing a folder in your computer that you can easily find and that you will routinely use for this class. Go ahead and create/select it.\nNote: when you selected your directory, code came out in the bottom left Console window. This is the setwd() command which can also be used directly to set your working directory in the future.\nIf you aren’t sure where your directory has been set, you can also type getwd() in your Console. Try it now\n\n\n## Example of where my directory was\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/Users/ktmccabe/Dropbox/GitHub2/dsps25\"\n\n\nIf I want to change the working directory, I can go to the top toolbar of my computer and use Session -&gt; Set Working Directory -&gt; Choose Directory or just type my file pathway using the setwd() below:\n\n## Example of setting the working directory using setwd().\n## Your computer will have your own file path.\nsetwd(\"/Users/ktmccabe/Dropbox/Rutgers Teaching/\")\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Saving the R Script\nLet’s now save our R script to our working directory and give it an informative name. To do so, go to File, then Save As, make sure you are in the same folder on your computer as the folder you chose for your working directory.\nGive the file an informative name, such as: “McCabeWeek1.R”. Note: all of your R scripts will have the .R extension.\n\n\n1.3.4 Annotating your R script\nNow that we have saved our R script, let’s work inside of it. Remember, we are in the top-left RStudio window now.\n\nJust like the beginning of a paper, you will want to title your R script. In R, any line that you start with a # will not be treated as a programming command. You can use this to your advantage to write titles/comments– annotations that explain what your code is doing. Below is a screenshot example of a template R script.\nYou can specify your working directory at the top, too. Add your own filepath inside setwd()\n\n\n\nThen you can start answering problems in the rest of the script.\nThink of the R script as where you write the final draft of your paper. In the Console (the bottom-left window), you can mess around and try different things, like you might when you are taking notes or outlining an essay. Then, write the final programming steps that lead you to your answer in the R script. For example, if I wanted to add 5 + 3, I might try different ways of typing it in the Console, and then when I found out 5 + 3 is the right approach, I would type that into my script.\n\n\n\n1.3.5 Running Commands in your R script\nThe last thing we will note in this section is how to execute commands in your R script.\nTo run / execute a command in your R script (the upper left window), you can\n\nHighlight the code you want to run, and then hold down “command + return” on a Mac or “control + enter” on Windows\nPlace your cursor at the end of the line of code (far right), and hit “command + return” on a Mac or “control + return” on Windows, or\nDo 1 or 2, but instead of using the keyboard to execute the commands, click “Run” in the top right corner of the upper-left window.\n\nTry it: Type 5 + 3 in the R script. Then, try to execute 5 + 3. It should look something like this:\n\nAfter you executed the code, you should see it pop out in your Console:\n\n5 + 3\n\n[1] 8\n\n\n\nNote: The symbol # also allows for annotation behind commands or on a separate line. Everything that follows # will be ignored by R. You can annotate your own code so that you and others can understand what each part of the code is designed to do.\n\n## Example\nsum53 &lt;- 5 + 3 # example of assigning an addition calculation\n\n\n\n1.3.6 Objects\nSometimes we will want to store our calculations as “objects” in R. We use &lt;- to assign objects by placing it to the left of what we want to store. For example, let’s store the calculation 5 + 3 as an object named sum53:\n\nsum53 &lt;- 5 + 3\n\nAfter we execute this code, sum53 now stores the calculation. This means, that if we execute a line of code that just has sum53, it will output 8. Try it:\n\nsum53\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nNow we no longer have to type 5 + 3, we can just type sum53. For example, let’s say we wanted to subtract 2 from this calculation. We could do:\n\nsum53 - 2\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nLet’s say we wanted to divide two stored calculations:\n\nten &lt;- 5 + 5\ntwo &lt;- 1 + 1\nten / two\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nThe information stored does not have to be numeric. For example, it can be a word, or what we would call a character string, in which case you need to use quotation marks.\n\nmccabe &lt;- \"professor for this course\"\nmccabe\n\n[1] \"professor for this course\"\n\n\nNote: Object names cannot begin with numbers and no spacing is allowed. Avoid using special characters such as % and $, which have specific meanings in R. Finally, use concise and intuitive object names.\n\nGOOD CODE: practice.calc &lt;- 5 + 3\nBAD CODE: meaningless.and.unnecessarily.long.name &lt;- 5 + 3\n\nWhile these are simple examples, we will use objects all the time for more complicated things to store (e.g., like full datasets!) throughout the course.\nWe can also store an array or “vector” of information using c()\n\nsomenumbers &lt;- c(3, 6, 8, 9)\nsomenumbers\n\n[1] 3 6 8 9\n\n\nImportance of Clean Code\nIdeally, when you are done with your R script, you should be able to highlight the entire script and execute it without generating any error messages. This means your code is clean. Code with typos in it may generate a red error message in the Console upon execution. This can happen when there are typos or commands are misused.\nFor example, R is case sensitive. Let’s say we assigned our object like before:\n\nsum53 &lt;- 5 + 3\n\nHowever, when we went to execute sum53, we accidentally typed Sum53:\n\nSum53\n\nError: object 'Sum53' not found\n\n\nOnly certain types of objects can be used in mathematical calculations. Let’s say we tried to divide mccabe by 2:\n\nmccabe / 2\n\nError in mccabe/2: non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n\nA big part of learning to use R will be learning how to troubleshoot and detect typos in your code that generate error messages.",

    "section": "1.4 R Markdown",
    "text": "1.4 R Markdown\nAn R Markdown document, which you can also create in RStudio, allows you to weave together regular text, R code, and the output of R code in the same document. This can be very convenient when conducting data analysis because it allows you more space to explain what you are doing in each step. We will use it as an effective platform for writing up problem sets.\nR Markdown documents can be “compiled” into html, pdf, or docx documents by clicking the Knit button on top of the upper-left window. Below is an example of what a compiled html file looks like.\n\nNote that the image has both written text and a gray chunk, within which there is some R code, as well as the output of the R code (e.g., the number 8 and the image of the histogram plot. \n\nWe say this is a “compiled” RMarkdown document because it differs from the raw version of the file, which is a .Rmd file format. Below is an example of what the raw .Rmd version looks like, compared to the compiled html version.\n \n\n1.4.1 Getting started with RMarkdown\nJust like with a regular R script, to work in R Markdown, you will open up RStudio.\n\nFor additional support beyond the notes below, you can also follow the materials provided by RStudio for getting started with R Markdown https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html.\n\nThe first time you will be working in R Markdown, you will want to install two packages: rmarkdown and knitr. You can do this in the Console window in RStudio (remember the lower-left window!).\nType the following into the Console window and hit enter/return.\n\ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\ninstall.packages(\"knitr\")\n\nOnce you have those installed, now, each time you want to create an R Markdown document, you will open up a .Rmd R Markdown file and get to work.\n\nGo to File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown in RStudio\n\nAlternatively, you can click the green + symbol at the top left of your RStudio window\n\nThis should open up a window with several options, similar to the image below\n\nCreate an informative title and change the author name to match your own\nFor now, we will keep the file type as html. In the future, you can create pdf or .doc documents. However, these require additional programs installed on your computer, which we will not cover in the course.\n\n\n\n\nAfter you hit “OK” a new .Rmd script file will open in your top-left window with some template language and code chunks, similar to the image below. Alternatively, you can start from scratch by clicking “Create Empty Document” or open a template .Rmd file of your own saved on your computer.\n\n\n\nSave as .Rmd file. Save the file by going to “File -&gt; Save as” in RStudio\n\n\nGive the file an informative name like your LastnamePractice1.Rmd\n\n\nKey Components. Now you are ready to work within the Rmd script file. We will point to four basic components of this file, and you can build your knowledge of RMarkdown from there.\n\nThe top part bracketed by --- on top and bottom is the YAML component. This tells RStudio the pertinent information about how to “compile” the Rmd file.\n\nMost of the time you can leave this alone, but you can always edit the title, author, or date as you wish.\n\nThe next component are the global options for the document. It is conveniently labeled “setup.” By default what this is saying is that the compiled version will “echo” (i.e., display all code chunks and output) unless you specifically specify otherwise. For example, note that it says include = FALSE for the setup chunk. That setting means that this code chunk will “run” but it will not appear in the nicely compiled .html file.\n\nMost of the time you will not need to edit those settings.\n\nThe third component I want to bring attention to is the body text. The # symbol in RMarkdown is used to indicate that you have a new section of the document. For example, in the compiled images at the beginning, this resulted in the text being larger and bolded when it said “Problem 2.” In addition to just using a single #, using ## or ### can indicate subsections or subsubsections. Other than that symbol, you can generally write text just as you would in any word processing program, with some exceptions, such as how to make text bold or italicized.\nThe final component I want to call attention to are the other main body code chunks. These are specific parts of the document where you want to create a mini R script. To create these, you can simply click the + C symbol toward the top of the top left window of RStudio and indicate you want an R chunk.\n\n\n\n\nWriting R Code. Within a code chunk, you can type R code just like you would in any R script, as explained in the previous section. However, in RMarkdown, you also have the option of running an entire code chunk at once by hitting the green triangle at the top-right of a given code chunk.\n\n\n\nKnitting the document. Once you have added a code chunk and/or some text, you are ready to compile or “Knit” the document. This is what generates the .html document.\n\nTo do so, click on the Knit button toward the top of the top-left window of Rstudio. After a few moments, this should open up a preview window displaying the compiled html file.\nIt will also save an actual .html file in your working directory (the same location on your computer where you have saved the .Rmd file)\nTry to locate this compiled .html file on your computer and open it. For most computers, .html files will open in your default web browser, such as Google Chrome or Safari.\nThis step is a common place where errors are detected and generated. Sometimes the compiling process fails due to errors in the R code in your code chunks or an error in the Markdown syntax. If your document fails to knit, the next step is to try to troubleshoot the error messages the compiling process generates. The best way to reduce and more easily detect errors is to “knit as you go.” Try to knit your document after each chunk of code you create.",

You should be able to complete this assignment after reviewing the course notes from this section and QSS chapter 1.\nWe will start walking through this assignment together during class, but you are welcome to try to do this ahead of time on your own.\nYou will submit three documents on Canvas:\n\nAn R script (.R) file with your code. Follow the best practices by titling your script and using # comments to explain your steps. This code should be clean. I should be able to run your code to verify that the code produces the answers you write down.\nAn .Rmd document and\nA compiled RMarkdown .html document that you get after “knitting” the .Rmd file. This should also have a title including your name and use text or # comments to explain your steps.\n\nYou can create these documents from scratch using the guidance in the previous sections, or you can download and open the .R and .Rmd templates, provided on Canvas, in RStudio to get started.\nThis video provides a brief overview of opening an R script and R Markdown file in RStudio with similar problems to those asked of you in the assignment. The notes in previous sections provide additional details.\n\nAssignment Exercises\n\nCreate a .R script saved as “LastnameSetup1.R” (use your last name). If you use the template on Canvas, after opening in RStudio, use File -&gt; Save As to change to create this file name. Within the body of this file, make sure to title it and provide your name.\n\nSet your working directory using the Session tab in RStudio.\nDo the calculation 8 + 3 - 5 in your R script. Store it as an object with an informative name. Report the answer as a comment # below the code.\nDo the calculation 7 x 3 in your R script. Store it as an object with an informative name. Report the answer as a comment # below the code.\nAdd these two calculations together. Note: do this by adding together the objects you created, not the underlying raw calculations. Report the answer as a # below the code.\n\nIn this problem, we will just re-format what we did in the first problem in an R Markdown format. Create a .Rmd R Markdown file saved as “LastnameSetup1.Rmd.” If you use the template on Canvas, after opening in RStudio, use File -&gt; Save As to change to create this file name. Within this file, make sure to title it and provide your name.\n\nCreate a Markdown heading # Problem 2.1. Underneath this, create an R code chunk in which you do the calculation 8 + 3 - 5. Store it as an object with an informative name. Report the answer in plain language below the code chunk.\nCreate a Markdown heading # Problem 2.2. Underneath this, create an R code chunk in which you do the calculation 7 x 3 in your R script. Store it as an object with an informative name. Report the answer in plain language below the code chunk.\nCreate a Markdown heading # Problem 2.3. Underneath this, create an R code chunk in which you add the previous two calculations together. Note: do this by adding together the objects you created, not the underlying raw calculations. Report the answer in plain language below the code chunk.\nCreate a Markdown heading # Problem 2.4. Write down how you will complete your R assignments this semester. For example, if you have a personal laptop with R and RStudio on it, you will simply write “I will use my personal laptop.” If you don’t have a personal computer or laptop, please indicate where on campus or off-campus you will have regular access to a computer with R/RStudio to do your work. It is essential that you have regular access to a computer so that you will not fall behind in this course.\n\nCreate a compiled .html file by “knitting” the .Rmd file into a .html document. Save the file as “LastnameSetup1.html.” This should happen automatically. The file will be located in the folder where the .Rmd file is also saved.\n\nAll done!

    "text": "2.3 Functions to summarize univariate data\nWe will use many “functions” in R, which are actions that we request R to perform with data. Functions take one or more inputs that you provide, “under the hood” perform a series of actions, and then produces one or more outputs. For example, if we supply the mean() function in R with a set of numbers, R will take the average of those numbers and then report the result.\nFor univariate data (data based on a single variable or changing characteristic), often we are interested in describing the range of the values and their central tendency. A central tendency reflects the mean or median.\n\nrange: the minimum (min()) and maximum (max()) values\nmean: the average value (mean())\n\nThe average is the sum of the values divided by the number of values:\n\\(\\bar{X} = \\frac{\\text{sum of values}}{\\text{number of values}} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_N}{N}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} x_i\\)\nLet’s do this in R for our set of 10 values\n\n(0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1)/10\n\n[1] 0.4\n\n\nThe average outcome is .4. Note: when a variable contains only 0’s and 1’s its mean is the proportion of 1’s. 40% of people think the economy is doing well.\n\n2.3.1 Step-by-step: Using functions in R (overview)\nA function is an action(s) that you request R to perform on an object or set of objects. For example, we will use the mean() function to ask R to take the mean or “average” of a vector.\n\nInside the function you place inputs or “arguments.”\n\n\nmean(Outcome)\n\n[1] 0.4\n\n\nR also has functions that take the sum sum() of a vector of values.\n\nsumofvalues &lt;- sum(Outcome)\n\nAnd that count the total number of values or “length” length() of the vector.\n\nnumberofvalues &lt;- length(Outcome)\n\nNote that the below is also equivalent to the mean\n\nsumofvalues / numberofvalues\n\n[1] 0.4\n\n\nReturning to our example, we found that 40% of people surveyed thought the economy was doing well. Surveying people about their opinions on how the country doing is a common way that social scientists use description. We could extend this exercise in many ways going forward, even with the same question.\n\nStart with a question: How is the economy doing?\nLet’s find a measure: Ask people if the economy is doing well.\nFind data points: Multiple people (we could stop there with the average!), or add more variables:\n\nAcross time: Survey people across multiple years\nAcross type of people: Survey different partisan groups\n\n\nThese types of trends are often used by news organizations and public opinion organizations like, Gallup.\n\nThis was just a first example of description in political science. There are many other ways to describe how the economy is doing and many other topics we might want to describe in politics.",

    "text": "2.4 Loading data into R\nFor this section, our motivating example will be methods to measure voter turnout in the United States.\nDescribing voter turnout\n\nWhat is a typical level of voter turnout?\nHow has turnout changed over time?\nIs turnout higher in presidential years or in midterm years?\n\nHow can we measure turnout? Think about the validity, reliability, and cost of different approaches.\nExample: Dataset on Voter Turnout in the U.S. across multiple years\n\nIn this dataset, each row is an election year. Each column contains information about the population, potential voters, or voter turnout. These will help us compute the turnout rate in a given year. To work with this dataset, we need to load it into R.\n\n2.4.1 Working with datasets in R\nFor a video explainer of the code in this section, see below. The video only discusses the code. Use the notes and lecture discussion for additional context. (Via youtube, you can speed up the playback to 1.5 or 2x speed.)\n\nOften the variables we care about are stored inside of rectangular datasets\n\nThese have a number of rows nrow() and columns ncol()\nEach row is an “observation,” representing the information collected from an individual or entity\nEach column is a variable, representing a changing characteristic across multiple observations\n\nWhen we import a dataset into R, we have a few options.\nOption 1: Download dataset to your computer\n\nMove the dataset to your working directory\nIdentify the file type (e.g., csv, dta, RData, txt)\nPick the appropriate R function to match the type (e.g., read.csv(), read.dta(), load(), read.table())\nAssign the dataset to an object. This object will now be class() of data.frame\n\n\nturnout &lt;- read.csv(\"turnout.csv\")\n\n\n\nClick here for an alternative function for csv files.\n\nSome scholars prefer to use the function read_csv to load csv data. It is better at handling more complicated types of data. We will not need to use this function in this course, but you may encounter it elsewhere.\nTo use this function, the first time we will go about using it, we have to first install a “package” called readr. Packages in R give us additional tools beyond what the base version of R provides. It is like installing an extra app on your phone.\n\ninstall.packages(\"readr\")\n\nOnce we have that installed, now anytime we want to use the function, we will call (open) the “readr” package using library(), and then the syntax is just like using the read.csv function.\n\nlibrary(readr)\nturnout &lt;- read_csv(\"turnout.csv\")\n\n\nOption 2: Read file from a url provided\n\nNeed an active internet connection for this to work\nURL generally must be public\nInclude the url inside the function used to read the data\n\n\nturnout &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktmccabe/teachingdata/main/turnout.csv\")\n\n\nclass(turnout)\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\n\nYou can also open up a window to view the data:\n\nView(turnout)\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Measuring the Turnout in the US Elections\nRelevant questions with voter turnout\n\nWhat is a typical level of voter turnout?\nIs turnout higher in presidential years or in midterm years?\nIs turnout higher or lower based on voting-eligible (VEP) or voting-age (VAP) populations? We have a lot of people who are citizens 18 and older who are ineligible to vote. This makes the VEP denominator smaller than the VAP.\n\nVoter Turnout in the U.S.\n\nNumerator: total: Total votes cast (in thousands)\nDenominator:\n\nVAP: (voting-age population) from Census\nVEP (voting-eligible population) VEP = VAP + overseas voters - ineligible voters\n\nAdditional Variables and Descriptions\n\nyear: election year\nANES: ANES self-reported estimated turnout rate\nVEP: Voting Eligible Population (in thousands)\nVAP: Voting Age Population (in thousands)\ntotal: total ballots cast for highest office (in thousands)\nfelons: total ineligible felons (in thousands)\nnoncitizens: total non-citizens (in thousands)\noverseas: total eligible overseas voters (in thousands)\nosvoters: total ballots counted by overseas voters (in thousands)\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Getting to know your data\n\n## How many observations (the rows)?\nnrow(turnout)\n\n[1] 14\n\n## How many variables (the columns)?\nncol(turnout)\n\n[1] 9\n\n## What are the variable names?\nnames(turnout)\n\n[1] \"year\"     \"VEP\"      \"VAP\"      \"total\"    \"ANES\"     \"felons\"   \"noncit\"  \n[8] \"overseas\" \"osvoters\"\n\n## Show the first six rows\nhead(turnout)\n\n  year    VEP    VAP total ANES felons noncit overseas osvoters\n1 1980 159635 164445 86515   71    802   5756     1803       NA\n2 1982 160467 166028 67616   60    960   6641     1982       NA\n3 1984 167702 173995 92653   74   1165   7482     2361       NA\n4 1986 170396 177922 64991   53   1367   8362     2216       NA\n5 1988 173579 181955 91595   70   1594   9280     2257       NA\n6 1990 176629 186159 67859   47   1901  10239     2659       NA\n\n\nExtract a particular column (vector) from the data using the $.\n\nturnout$year\n\n [1] 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2008\n\n\nExtract the 10th year.

Ultimately, a dataframe just binds together multiple vectors / columns to create a rectangular object.\nFor example, let’s say we want to create a dataframe with columns indicating just the midterm years and their VEP turnout. These correspond to the two vectors:\n\nturnout$newVEPturnout[seq(2, 12, 2)]\nturnout$year[seq(2, 12, 2)]\n\nIn R, you can create a rectangular data.frame object with the data.frame function.\n\nWithin this function, you can make several entries that follow the syntax colname = values. We supply what we would like the name of the column to be, such as midyear, and then provide R with a set of values. We can then provide a comma and add more columns.\n\nYou just want to make sure each column has the same number of values.\n\n\n\nmidtermdata &lt;- data.frame(midyear = turnout$year[seq(2, 12, 2)], \n                          VEPturnout = turnout$newVEPturnout[seq(2, 12, 2)])\n\nYou can supply the values for each column using objects or just vectors of raw numeric values like the below:\n\nmidtermdata &lt;- data.frame(midyear = c(1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002), \n                          VEPturnout = c(42.13701, 38.14115, 38.41895, 41.12625, 38.09316, 39.51064))\n\nThe result is a nice rectangular dataframe similar to what we loaded using the turnout.csv dataset from outside of R.\n\nmidtermdata\n\n  midyear VEPturnout\n1    1982   42.13701\n2    1986   38.14115\n3    1990   38.41895\n4    1994   41.12625\n5    1998   38.09316\n6    2002   39.51064\n\n\nNow, because our dataframe has a different name.

    "text": "2.8 Wrapping Up Description\nIn this section, we have described voter turnout using multiple measures and types of elections. There are several other questions that political scientists may be interested in when it comes to voter turnout.\nFor example, during and following the 2020 elections, many states passed laws that changed election procedures: Ability to vote by mail, Ballot dropboxes, Length of early voting. What else?\n\nWhat effect (if any) do these laws have on voter turnout?\n\nIn the next section, we start to examine how to evaluate causal claims.\n\n2.8.1 Summary of R tools\nWe have touched on a number of R tools thus far. Here is a summary of some of the key items to remember going forward:\n\nsetwd(): sets the working directory in R, which tells R which folder on your computer contains the datasets or other R files where you will be working. You should get into the habit of setting your working directory each time you work in RStudio.\n\nCan set this in the toolbar Session -&gt; Set Working Directory -&gt; Choose Directory, followed by clicking the “Open” button on the folder where you want to work.\nExample: setwd(\"~/Downloads/Data Science\")\n\n##: Hashtags are used to help annotate your code. Anything behind a hashtag is treated as plain text\n+ - * /: These are some of the mathematical operators you can use in R\n\nYou can also control which operations are performed first using () just like you would do with math outside of R. For example, try to compare the answer to 6 + 4 * 3 with (6 + 4) * 3\n\n&lt;-: This is an assignment tool that allows us to store calculations, vectors, datasets, and more as objects in R.\n\nExample: sum53 &lt;- 5 + 3 creates an object called sum53 that stores the calculation on the right.\n\n[]: Brackets are used to extract specific components of objects we create. The number(s) inside the brackets tell us which entries to extract.\n\nExample: Outcome[2] will tell us to extract the second entry in the object Outcome\nNote: when we use datasets, the brackets will have two entries, one corresponding to the row entry and one corresponding to the column. Example turnout[1,2] means the entry in the first row and second column.\n\n\nFunctions We have already started using a number of functions in R, which are operations we ask R to do for us, such as creating vectors, importing data, or summarizing data by finding the mean, range, etc. Functions come in the same format, which starts with the function name followed by parentheses. Example: mean(). Each function then takes a particular input(s). When you “run” a line of code with a function, R applies the function to the input.\n\nc(): This is a function that combines a set of values into a vector in R. The values can be numbers or text items and should be separated by commas. If text, each text item should be in quotation marks.\n\nExample: Outcome &lt;- c(3, 4, 6, 2, 1)\nExample: People &lt;- c(\"Sam\", \"Julie\", \"Mark\")\n\nmean(), median(), min(), max(), range(): These functions summarize vectors that are numeric/integers in nature.\n\nExample mean(Outcome) takes the average of the values in the Outcome vector\n\nread.csv(): This function loads a rectangular .csv file into R as a data.frame\n\nExample: turnout &lt;- read.csv(\"turnout.csv\")\nNot all datasets will be .csv files. In the future, we will use other functions, such as load() or read.dta() to import datasets of different file types.\n\n\nDataframes\nWe have started working with dataframes in R. These objects are rectangular datasets that include a collection of vectors. Every column in a dataframe generally represents a different concept or “variable,” while each row represents a different unit or “observation.”\n\n$: When we are working with vectors that are inside of a dataframe (the columns inside of a dataframe), we use the $ to access them.\n\nExample: turnout$year will show us the values in the year column vector inside our turnout rectangular dataframe\n\nnrow(), ncol(), dim(), head(), names(): These functions help us explore the dataframes by telling us the number of rows and columns (the dimensions), giving us a sneak peek of the first 6 rows of the dataframe, or showing us the names of the variables (columns) in the data.\n\nExample: nrow(turnout)",
